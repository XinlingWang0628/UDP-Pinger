# UDP-Pinger
This repository contains a simple UDP client-server simulation implemented in Python. The server program, server.py, is designed to handle UDP requests and respond to client pings. It incorporates a straightforward mechanism to simulate occasional packet loss by dropping random packets, enhancing the realism of network communication.
